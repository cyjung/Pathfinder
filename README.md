Pathfinder
==========
This project is an interactive pathfinding application.  
It uses a grid of squares, or nodes, on which a starting point, and endpoint, or walls can be placed.
They can be placed by holding the appropriate key and clicking on a node.
Green starting point:                 Z
Red endpoint:                         X
Blue wall:                            C
Movable endpoint (using arrow keys):  V

Once a start and end have been placed a path will be found if possible and the starting point will move along the path until it reaches the end.
The path can be seen by pressing Tab.
The traversal of the path can be paused/unpaused with the spacebar.
